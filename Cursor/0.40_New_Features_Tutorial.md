# Cursor 0.40 New Features Tutorial

## Context

Cursor 0.40 brings several exciting new features and improvements to enhance your coding experience. This update focuses on a new chat user interface, default-on Composer functionality, and an improved Cursor Tab model. These changes aim to streamline your workflow and make AI-assisted coding more efficient and user-friendly.

## New Chat UX

### Simple Working Example

To experience the new chat UX, follow these steps:

1. Open Cursor 0.40
2. Navigate to the chat interface (usually accessible via a chat icon or keyboard shortcut)
3. Start a new conversation with the AI assistant

  ```typescript
  // Example of using the new chat UX
  // Open a chat and type:
  "Can you explain how to use async/await in JavaScript?"
  ```

### Detailed Guidance

- The new chat UX is designed to be more intuitive and responsive.
- Pay attention to the layout changes and new interactive elements.
- Experiment with different types of queries to see how the AI responds in the new interface.

### Things to Watch Out For

- Some keyboard shortcuts or interaction patterns may have changed. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the new layout.
- If you were used to the old chat interface, there might be a short adjustment period.

## Default-On Composer

### Simple Working Example

To use the new default-on Composer:

1. Open any file in your project
2. Press `cmd+I` (or `ctrl+I` on Windows/Linux)
3. Start typing your instructions for code generation or modification

  ```typescript
  // Example: Generate a simple React component
  // Press cmd+I and type:
  "Create a React functional component named UserProfile that displays a user's name and email"
  ```

### Detailed Guidance

- The Composer is now available to all Pro/Business users by default.
- You can use it to generate code, refactor existing code, or get explanations.
- Composer Projects (beta) allow you to share instructions among several composers.

### Things to Watch Out For

- Be specific in your instructions to get the best results.
- Remember that while the AI is powerful, it's not infallible. Always review and test generated code.

## New Cursor Tab Model

### Simple Working Example

To experience the new Cursor Tab model:

1. Open a TypeScript file
2. Start typing a function or variable name
3. Press Tab to see the AI's suggestions

  ```typescript
  // Example: Start typing a function to fetch user data
  function fetchUser
  // Press Tab and see how the new model completes the function
  ```

### Detailed Guidance

- The new Cursor Tab model is designed to be smarter and more context-aware.
- It should provide more accurate and relevant code completions.
- For TypeScript files, there's a beta feature for auto-imports when Tab suggests an unimported symbol.

### Things to Watch Out For

- To enable auto-imports for TypeScript, go to Settings > Features > Cursor Tab.
- The model's suggestions are based on context, so make sure your code is well-structured for best results.

## Conclusion

Cursor 0.40 brings significant improvements to the chat interface, introduces a powerful default-on Composer, and enhances the Cursor Tab model. These features are designed to make your coding experience more efficient and enjoyable. Remember to explore and practice with these new features to fully leverage their capabilities in your development workflow.
