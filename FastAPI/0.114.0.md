# FastAPI 0.114.0

## Context

FastAPI 0.114.0 introduces support for Pydantic models in Form parameters. This feature allows for more structured and validated handling of form data in FastAPI applications.

## New Feature: Form Models

### Overview

Prior to this version, handling form data was limited to individual form fields. With this update, you can now use Pydantic models to define the structure and validation rules for entire forms.

### Example

Let's create a simple example to demonstrate this new feature:

  ```python
  from typing import Annotated
  from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  app = FastAPI()

  class UserForm(BaseModel):
      username: str
      password: str
      email: str | None = None

  @app.post("/login/")
  async def login(form_data: Annotated[UserForm, Form()]):
      return {"username": form_data.username, "email": form_data.email}
  ```

In this example, we define a `UserForm` model that represents our form structure. The `login` endpoint uses this model to validate and parse the form data.

### How It Works

1. Define a Pydantic model for your form structure.
2. Use the `Form()` annotation along with your model in the path operation function.
3. FastAPI will automatically parse and validate the incoming form data according to your model.

### Advanced Usage: Forbidding Extra Form Fields

You can also configure your form model to forbid any extra fields not defined in the model:

  ```python
  from typing import Annotated
  from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  app = FastAPI()

  class StrictUserForm(BaseModel):
      username: str
      password: str
      email: str | None = None

      model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}

  @app.post("/strict-login/")
  async def strict_login(form_data: Annotated[StrictUserForm, Form()]):
      return {"username": form_data.username, "email": form_data.email}
  ```

In this case, if any extra fields are sent in the form that are not defined in `StrictUserForm`, FastAPI will raise a validation error.

## Things to Watch Out For

1. **File Uploads**: Remember that for file uploads, you should still use `UploadFile` or `bytes` with the `File()` annotation.

2. **Content-Type**: Ensure that your client is sending the correct `Content-Type` header for form data (usually `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`).

3. **Validation**: All Pydantic validation rules apply to these form models. Make sure your form data meets the defined constraints.

4. **OpenAPI Documentation**: The OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation will automatically reflect these form models, improving your API's self-documentation.

## Conclusion

FastAPI 0.114.0's introduction of Pydantic models for form data brings a more structured and type-safe approach to handling forms. This enhancement allows for better code organization, improved validation, and more self-documenting APIs when working with form data. By leveraging Pydantic models, you can create more robust and maintainable FastAPI applications that handle form submissions effectively.
